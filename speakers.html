    <div class="talktitle">Human Computer Symbiosis: Building Information Systems From The Human Perspective</div>
    <div class="abstract">
    <p>As computer scientists, we tend to factor the world into problem silos that seem to be interesting from a computability standpoint (faster algorithms, new data structures, etc.).</p>
    <p>The goal of HCS-centered design is to factor the world into questions that are interesting from a human standpoint and then factor the solution into something computable. This factoring will tend to cut across established silos and the solution will tend to incorporate techniques and architectures found in classically separate areas of computer science scholarship and research.</p>
    <p>Palantir is actively engaged in building these conceptual information systems. In this talk, Ari Gordon-Schlosberg will explore the historical context of HCS as a system design philosophy, explore how its goals are very different from what AI tried and failed to accomplish, and present some real world examples of how HCS builds better information systems.</p>

    <div class="abstract">
    <p>How many times have you seen a repetitive task performed by hand and thought, "it would be so easy to automate that?" Automation technology has existed for decades and continues to increase in capability even as the price drops. However, many of the people who might benefit from it the most are largely unaware of its capabilities. This talk will examine possible reasons for why this is the case, and how software can be used to better address the needs of this largely untapped market.</p>

    <p><i>Please note: Dr. McGraw has informed us that due to circumstances beyond his control, he regretfully will not be able to attend the conference.  His talk timeslot will be replaced with Yahoo! Hack Day presentations.</i></p>
    <p>This talk (based on a book of the same title co-authored by Greg Hoglund) frankly describes controversial security issues surrounding MMORPGs such as World of Warcraft. This no-holds-barred approach is fully loaded with code examples, debuggers, bots, and hacks. If you are a gamer, a game developer, a software security person or an interested bystander, this book exposes the inner workings of online game security for all to see. In the talk, I will cover:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Why online games are a harbinger of software security issues to come</li>
      <li>How millions of gamers have created billion dollar virtual economies</li>
      <li>How game companies invade your privacy</li>
      <li>Why some gamers cheat</li>
      <li>Techniques for breaking online game security</li>
      <li>How to build a bot to play a game for you</li>
      <li>Methods for total conversion and advanced mods</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Ultimately, this talk is mostly about security problems associated with advanced massively distributed software. With hundreds of thousands of interacting users, today's online games are a bellwether of modern software yet to come. The kinds of attack and defense techniques I describe are tomorrow's security techniques on display today.</p>

    <div class="talktitle">The Arms Race Over Virtualization</div>
    <div class="abstract">
    <p>Five years from now, none of us will be using "real" computers anymore. Every interaction we have with our laptops, web applications, and file shares will be intercepted and emulated through hypervisors: thin layers of software that allow a single silicon CPU core to pretend to multiple virtual machines. And attackers who can negotiate the barriers between physical and virtual machines will seize sweeping powers to steal data, infect computers, and hide their presence.</p>
	<p>Enterprise IT is a key theater in the three-front war being fought between information security teams and organized crime. If the enterprise falls, attackers will ignore web application security and harvest identities and bank accounts directly from the source. If the enterprise falls, attackers will ignore DRM and steal high-definition DVD masters or game source code right off of corporate file servers. And every enterprise IT team in the world is migrating to virtualized servers. Is the sky falling?</p>
	<p>My team tried to find out. In 2006, we developed a proof-of-concept rootkit programmed directly to the hardware virtualization features of the Intel chipset. In 2007, we spent a year in a high-tech sparring match with ultra-clever security researcher Joanna Rutkowska, author of the "Blue Pill" hypervisor rootkit for AMD, whose research goal is the creation of undetectable stealth malware.</p>
	<p>Our talk is a deep dive into virtualization technology and computer security. We'll show how hypervisors work, and how we used those concepts to invent "hyperjacking", which virtualizes a running operating system out from under itself. Then we'll explain how antivirus software can detect a hyperjacker just as easily as a kernel virus. And we'll explain how a Google researcher may have opened the floodgates to vulnerabilities that will plague hypervisor kernels for years to come, and why local crypto timing attacks mean you shouldn't take credit cards on a shared Xen web server. You'll get some perspective on how information security interacts with operating system theory, and, perhaps unexpectedly, come to see virtualization as a win for security.</p>

    <p>A programming-language designer makes rules to match what programmers want, whereas a linguist makes rules to match what natural-language speakers do. The same formal tools that relate form to meaning are useful on both sides. To illustrate this link, we discuss how <em>side effects</em> such as <em>mutable state</em> and <em>delimited control</em> interact with <em>quoted</em> expressions. In computer science, this interaction helps us generate faster code more easily. In linguistics, it explains why "somebody loves everybody" is ambiguous but "anybody loves nobody" makes no sense.</p>

    <div class="abstract">
    <p>When historical artifacts make the leap into the digital realm through different forms of capture and transcription, they not only leave behind their corporeality, but they also become separated from the delicate, institutionally realized web of "scholarship" that is anchored in certain aspects of their physical character. This talk will first describe a few of the ways in which the physical attributes of a particular family of historical artifacts--handwritten manuscripts and printed pages--have played a formative and productive role in humanities scholarship at both the individual and institutional levels. It will then briefly and selectively survey the recent history and current state of the discipline at the intersection of computer science and the humanities--"digital humanities" scholarship--with a view to showing how things can go spectacularly wrong when the aforementioned physical attributes are (mis)cast as the unfortunate "constraints" and "limitations" of an outmoded "information medium." The talk will conclude with a set of specific recommendations for recreating in the digital realm the aspects of manuscripts and books that are the most critically productive for humanities scholarship.</p>

    <div class="talktitle">Machine Virtualization</div>
    <div class="abstract">
    <p>Although virtual machines have been around since the 1960's, they have only recently become widely used on PC-based servers and clients. Today they are commonly used in the datacenter to reduce capital and operational costs. They are also used on the desktop for software development and application compatibility. Fueled by recent advances in processor virtualization technologies, software developers continue to propose new uses for virtual machines. So what's with all the hype? Are virtual machines really the answer to many of today's computing problems? In his talk, Eric Traut will discuss the basic concepts involved in machine virtualization and provide an architectural overview of Microsoft's soon-to-be-released hypervisor. He will also discuss some of the factors that are driving the interest in virtual machines and talk about where virtualization should (and perhaps more importantly, shouldn't) be applied.</p>

    <div class="talktitle">Computers and the Education Industry</div>
    <div class="abstract">
    <p>Although there have been many interesting experiments, technology investment in the education industry is the lowest of any major industry group. As a result, people are used very inefficiently; school taxes and tuition are becoming progressively more outlandish. But it is not all that easy to figure out where to apply automation in education.

		We shall try to sort out where people are needed and where machines can be adequate substitutes. We then turn to college-level education, especially in Computer Science. Are textbooks a thing of the past? Does the ability of schools to pipe lectures into the dorms radically change the economics of education? Finally, we shall look at what has been the speaker's personal "research" project since retirement: an attempt to automate the sort of homeworks that one normally finds in CS courses.</p>

    <div class="talktitle">Using OpenBSD Security Features to Find Software Bugs</div>
    <div class="abstract">
    <p>This talk will discuss how OpenBSD's security features and exploit mitigation techniques find real bugs in the process of porting software. Porting third party applications often results in discovering classes of bugs that cause spurious crashes on other systems, but can be reliably detected and fixed in OpenBSD. All bugs are patched and reported upstream, meaning the process not only improves the security and robustness of OpenBSD, but also that of the individual applications. For example, using ProPolice, a gcc modification that catches stack-smashing problems, we were able to detect many potentially exploitable bugs at runtime. In this talk, I will describe how you can use several such techniques to find similarly pesky software bugs.</p>

    <div class="talktitle">Compiling JavaScript for the JVM</div>
    <div class="abstract">
    <p>Mozilla Rhino (JavaScript) is now officially bundled with Java 6 as "javax.script", making it one of the leading choices for alternate languages hosted on the Java Virtual Machine. My dev team at Google has been using Rhino as a server-side web development language for over a year, and it has proven to be a capable, mature, and surprisingly adaptable language platform. Perhaps the biggest surprise has been its excellent performance, the result of a decade of tuning and compiler optimizations by the Rhino open-source dev team. In this talk I'll give a high-level overview of life using JavaScript as a replacement for Java (specifically in the context of our Ruby on Rails port), followed by a deep dive into the Rhino runtime and byte compiler. We'll look at some of the challenges of compiling this high-level dynamic language into efficient Java bytecode.</p>
